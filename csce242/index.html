            <img src="images/flexpage.jpg" alt="Flex Page Layout" class="assignment-image">
            <p>I recreated a simple page layout given to us by Professor Plante and used CSS styling and flexbox to format it properly. I used elements such as flex, padding, width, and other elements of styling. I also used Media Query to allow the webpage to display horizontally on large screens and vertically on smaller screens.</p>
